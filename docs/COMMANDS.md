# Commands
This is a list of commands for the Identity Enforcement Drone. When entering parameters, please enclose anything you would like to be read as a sentence in quotes. For example: `"this will be read as a sentence"`, but `these will be read as a list of seperate words.`

Required command parameters are enclosed in `[square brackets]`, optional parameters are enclosed in `<these funky boys>`

The words in parentheses e.g `!id enforce (assign)` are aliases, meaning a command can be used under multiple different names where applicable.
