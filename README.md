## Self Hosting

If you'd like to host this bot yourself, you'll need:

- A Discord bot token, placed in a `bot_token.txt` file in the root of this directory.
- Installed the requirements (just `discord.py`) in requirements.txt using `pip`.
- A pinch of fairy dust.

Once you've gathered these ingredients, you should be able to start the bot by running `main.py`, unless I've forgotten a vital step.
